    <meta name="description" content="Based in the North West, I am a recent graduate from Edge Hill with aspirations of becoming a front-end web developer. I have recently completed a BSc in Web Design & Development, where I am predicted to graduate with a high 1:1. I am an ambitious, personable and driven individual with a track record demonstrating passion, resilience and determination, shown by recently being awarded the ‘Academic Achievement Award’. Over the course of my degree, I have acquired knowledge and experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Laravel, Ember, version control, and mySQL. Also, outside of academia, I am actively learning new skills, such as Gulp and Sass. I am now actively seeking a junior or graduate role in web design and development, where I can demonstrate my passion for all things creative and technological. As an aspiring web developer, I am eager to utilise my interpersonal skills and enhance the foundation of knowledge I have acquired throughout my degree.">
