          <p>My initial thought was to analyse and deconstruct the design to see which approach was best suited. As the test was to construct the hero element of the design, I printed the design off for further inspection, which led me to lead with a design using CSS grid. The design, with its different elements, gave the appearance of an already laid out grid design.</p>
          <p>Design aside, I began to think about creating the bespoke WordPress theme and how best to integrate the design. It made sense to stick my method of creating the design first, then converting it into a WordPress theme. I knew this was time-sensitive so there was no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>

          <h1 class="Document__approach__content--title text__left__content--title">Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your <span class="italic">approach</span><span class="orange">.</span></h1>
          <p>Once I had taken the time to analyse the design and gather my thoughts regarding the design, I set out to undertake the build of the test presented. My approach to this task was no different from any other that I start. The build is constructed mobile-first and is fully responsive with the implementation of CSS grid and flexbox throughout. I am a huge fan of using nested CSS and compilers, so as always, SASS and Gulp have been utilised.</p>
          <p>The hero section has many elements and has been built using CSS grid with individual elements also implementing flexbox. As the specification was for this to be converted into a WordPress theme, it was important for me to ensure that all elements of the design could be changed within WordPress’s dashboard. Every element of the design can indeed with controlled using the dashboard with the inclusion of the Advanced Custom Fields plugin, allowing the owner to freely add or remove the content as they please.</p>
          <p>There are elements of the design that aren’t functional, such as the menu on the left side and the links in the lower element. For this test, I wanted to recreate the design as closely as possible in the time frame that I had. Of course, these elements could be built to be dynamic as seen in my previous work.</p>

          <h1 class="Document__reflection__content--title text__right__content--title">Did you ever wonder if the person in the puddle is real, and you're just a <span class="italic">reflection</span> of him<span class="orange">?</span></h1>
          <p>As with any piece of work, I find it is very useful to reflect on what was achieved, what went well, and what could be done differently. This has always been my space where I can be completely honest and critical of one's self.</p>
          <p>When I first saw the design, I liked it. I thought it was very cool and something that I could get stuck into and give it my best shot. Now the test is complete, I can honestly say that it was a very enjoyable experience.</p>
          <p>Overall, I’m relatively pleased with the outcome and if I consider it took around a day and a half, I’m pleased with myself. There are some elements that I am not happy with. The slider in the main content area is a poor representation of the design, but as that section wasn’t functioning, I just wanted to create the appearance of the element. The arrow in the content isn’t quite right, but the arrow on font awesome was only available with ‘pro’. The lower navigation panel isn’t functional and again, it’s just been styled as per the design. These are minor points but could give off the impression that it isn’t achievable for me.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, there are elements that I’m not thrilled with, but I’ve learnt a lot with this test, and it’s been a great experience.</p>

          <p>I just wanted to thank you for this opportunity, for seeing something in my previous work or myself that warranted you giving me the chance to undertake this test. It’s been a fun challenge and I’m truly appreciative of the opportunity. Your work is an inspiration and your website is truly awesome, it’s so impressive and to potentially have the chance to work with is exciting and truly would be an honour.</p>
